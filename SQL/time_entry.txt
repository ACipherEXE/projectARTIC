Note: dates, time and etc are handled by this table and not the user punching
Also that when a studnet ID is deleted that all their logs will disapear
If a student ID does not exsist then it will throw a ERROR as its checking for it in student table
// insert userID
INSERT INTO entry_log (studentid) VALUES ('STU001');

//How to edit time of late
ALTER TABLE entry_log 
ALTER COLUMN is_late SET DEFAULT (CURRENT_TIME > '08:30:00');
